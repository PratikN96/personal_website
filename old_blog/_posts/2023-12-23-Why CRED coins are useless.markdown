I recently came across a post on X about shifting to Cheq and leaving Cred because there are rewards. Other comments also mentioned the same citing useless Cred Coins.

After analysing CRED Coins i.e the gamified ecosystem, it all made sense - 

1. Activities not aligned with the goals

2. Very easy to earn coins

3. Coins don’t hold much value as output

4. No devaluation of coins

#### Activities not aligned with the goals
So far, given the marketing spend and Kunal Shah’s own views, the focus has been on user acquisition.

But none of the gamification activities in any sense aligns with this goal. The current version is just a simple two-step process -   play game -> get coupon/coins

The reward i.e coupons are applicable on 3rd party apps/websites and thus too much friction to realise its value.

The whole reward section of the app is just a beautiful decluttered version of coupondunia.



#### Very easy to earn coins
There’s no aspect of any challenge in earning coins. Every activity either lands on coupons or coins.

There’s no scarcity of coins at any point in the user timeline.

It would have been better if earning coins were limited to functions of playing credit card bill, electricity, payment, etc which are core use cases.

#### Coins don’t hold much value as output
What can I do with CRED coins? Get random coupons.

Just looking at some popular benefits rewarded by credit card users can give us a slight idea of what users value the most -
Direct cashback

Utility payment discount

Flipkart, Swiggy, uber, dinning etc discount

Travel benefits, hotel memberships

On top of that coins hold no value of its own - use 2000 coins to get 30%, 40% or 70% discount.

#### No devaluation of coins
I opened CRED after 6-7 months to analyse the coin system and to my surprise, coins were still the same(around 80k) when I last used them.
Coins are not related to time at all, I haven’t been reprimanded for my inactivity. So, I will never have any fear of losing those coins and investing time in the app to save/hold them.

The whole gamification is like having a treasure chest on a remote deserted island.

I tried to redesign the gamification journey roughly -
